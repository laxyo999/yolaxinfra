						Yolax Infranergy has always been a part of consultancy services for railways with the use of Modern surveying techniques and instruments. The feasibility studies are the first analysis to be carried out once the implementation of a construction has been decided. The study determines if the construction is feasible and will establish the technical and financial basis for the rest of the design and execution process of the design of the works. 
					</p>
					<p>Steps in feasibility study of a railway project:</p>
	
					<ul class="arrow_list">
				        <li>Presentation of geographical social and economic environment of the project.</li>
				        <li>Establishment of development needed(design capacity and phasing),</li>
				        <li>Impact and risk analysis.</li>
				        <li>Health and safety complying with national codes requirements.</li>
				        <li>Passenger safety and security.</li>
