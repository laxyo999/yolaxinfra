				<h3>Survey for Construction Plan</h3>
					<p>
						Construction Surveys calculate and mark on the ground where, both horizontally and vertically, specific design elements are to be placed and constructed. This process is to stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as rail/roads or buildings. These markers are usually staked out according to a suitable coordinate system selected for the project.
