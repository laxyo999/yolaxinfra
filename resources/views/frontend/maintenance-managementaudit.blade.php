				<h3>Maintenance Management Audit</h3>
					<p>
						The Maintenance Audit approach is to collect information on your current maintenance processes, and from the maintenance information systems used at your operation, and analyse them for maintenance process improvement opportunities. A maintenance audit permits you to review the effectiveness of your maintenance management system and processes at delivering the equipment reliability and plant availability you want.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yolax has established maintenance management consulting for the clients which will take care of preliminary audit and final audit of maintenance system of the plant and than physically verifying the same.

						<li>Basic practices must be implemented first</li>
						<li>Improving reliability and maintenance is 90% about people</li>
						<li>People cannot be more effective than the system they work in allows them to be</li>
